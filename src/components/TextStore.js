//       Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her friends
//       were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City. The streets
//       were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded
//       everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a pavement of the
//       same green marble, and where the blocks were joined together were rows of
//       emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the brightness of the sun. The
//       window panes were of green glass; even the sky above the City had a green
//       tint, and the rays of the sun were green.{"\n\n"}There were many
//       people--men, women, and children--walking about, and these were all
//       dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They looked at Dorothy
//       and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes, and the children
//       all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion; but no
//       one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the street, and Dorothy saw that
//       everything in them was green. Green candy and green pop corn were offered
//       for sale, as well as green shoes, green hats, and green clothes of all
//       sorts. At one place a man was selling green lemonade, and when the
//       children bought it Dorothy could see that they paid for it with green
//       pennies.{"\n\n"}There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the
//       men carried things around in little green carts, which they pushed before
//       them. Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.{"\n"}
